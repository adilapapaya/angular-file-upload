## About

This is a fork of the [**Angular File Upload**](https://github.com/nervgh/angular-file-upload/) project by [nervgh](https://github.com/nervgh/). The difference between this and the main branch is that this branch ensures that any 'drag over' classes are removed on drag leave.

To `gulp build` or `gulp watch`:
